									Standard

								<img src="images/Standard GameCube Controller.png" alt="Standard GameCube Controller" class="accordion-images" />

								<div class="lid">&nbsp;</div>

								<p>
									Released alongside the GameCube console, the standard GameCube controller has a wing grip design.
									This controller was bundled with all new GameCube systems throughout the console's life cycle and was also available separately.
									It connects to the console's controller ports via a 2 m/6.5 ft cable.
								</p>
								<p>
									The standard GameCube controller provides haptic feedback by way of a built-in rumble motor
									rather than using an external Rumble Pak add-on like the Nintendo 64 controller.
									Also unlike its predecessor, this controller does not feature any expansion capabilities.
								</p>
								<p>
									The controller features a total of six digital buttons, two analog sticks, a d-pad and two hybrid analog triggers/digital buttons.

									WaveBird

								<img src="images/Wavebird GameCube Controller.jpg" alt="WaveBird GameCube Controller" class="accordion-images" />

								<div class="lid">&nbsp;</div>

								<p>
									The WaveBird, designed and sold by Nintendo, released in 2002.
									Unlike most wireless controllers of its era, it relies on radio frequency communication instead of infrared line-of-sight signal transmission.
									This solved many of the previous usability problems of wireless controllers and allowed it to be used anywhere within 6 meters (20 ft) of the console.
								</p>
								<p>
									The WaveBird includes a small receiver unit which must be plugged into the controller port of the GameCube.
									Made of the same gray-colored plastic as the standard WaveBird, it features a channel-selection wheel and an LED to indicate when a signal is received.
									Up to sixteen WaveBird controllers may be used in the same area if each is set to a different channel.

								<div class="lid">&nbsp;</div>
								<br />

								<p>
									The ASCII keyboard controller resembles a standard GameCube controller pad stretched to accommodate an alphanumeric keyboard in the center.
								</p>
								<p>
									The keyboard requires the use of two controller ports and contains both Latin and Japanese hiragana characters.
								</p>
								<p>
									It was developed for use with Phantasy Star Online Episode I & II.

									The GameCube Game Boy Player shown under a GameCube before being attached. A Game Boy Advance cartridge has been inserted.
								</p>
								<p>
									The Game Boy Player (DOL-017) is a device made by Nintendo for the Nintendo GameCube which enables Game Boy, Game Boy Color,
									or Game Boy Advance cartridges to be played on a television.
								</p>
								<p>
									It connects via the high speed parallel port at the bottom of the GameCube and requires use of a boot disc to access the hardware.
									The Game Boy Player does not use software emulation, but instead uses physical hardware nearly identical to that of a Game Boy Advance.
								</p>

									<div class="lid">&nbsp;</div>


									<p>
										Nintendo released two networking accessories for the GameCube in October 2002 produced by Conexant,
										the Broadband Adapter and the Modem Adapter (a 56k dial-up modem).
									</p>
									<p>
										The adapters fit flush into "Serial Port 1" on the underside of the GameCube.
									</p>
									<p>
										The Broadband Adapter is built for faster internet speeds and adds an ethernet jack to
										the side of the console while the Modem Adapter adds a phone jack and operates through dial-up.

									Memory Cards
								</h3>
								<img src="images/Memory Card.jpg" alt="GameCube Memory Card" class="accordion-images" />
								<div class="lid">&nbsp;</div>

								<p>
									Memory cards for the GameCube were available in three different capacities,
									each in a different colour: Memory Card 59 (4 Mbit) in grey, 251 (16 Mbit) in black, and 1019 (64 Mbit) in white.
								</p>
								<p>
									A maximum of 127 files can be stored on a single card.
								</p>
								<p>
									Each card requires 5 blocks of system data meaning that the actual size of cards are 64, 256, or 1024 respectively.

								<h3>
									GameCube Microphone
								</h3>
								<img src="images/Microphone GameCube.jpg" alt="GameCube Microphone" class="accordion-images" />
								<div class="lid">&nbsp;</div>

								<p>
									Nintendo released a microphone for the GameCube video game console.
								</p>
								<p>
									The microphone connects to a memory card slot instead of a controller port.
									The reason for this design decision is probably that Nintendo wanted to keep the possibility of creating games
									enabled for four controllers and a microphone.
								</p>
								<p>
									It functions with Mario Party 6, Mario Party 7, Karaoke Revolution Party, Odama, Chibi-Robo and Densetsu no Quiz Ou Ketteisen.
									Odama also includes a clip to attach the microphone to the controller.
									The microphone has a coloured button that can be pushed to activate the microphone in these games.
